Abstract: We investigate the relationships between spatial ability, time spent on homework, lecture
clicker participation, and grades in an introductory engineering graphics class. Out of mental
rotation test performance, hours spent on homework, and lecture attendance/participation, the
first was found to have the most effect on a studentâ€™s total course score.

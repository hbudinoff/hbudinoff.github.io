Abstract: The impact of spatial visualization ability on student outcomes in a freshman-level, 3D
modeling class is explored by analyzing connections between studentsâ€™ spatial ability pre- and
post-test scores, course grades, and self-reported difficulty of an assignment. Analysis of the
results indicate that spatial visualization ability, as measured by the post-test, is strongly
correlated with perceived difficulty, exam grades, and overall course grade. Students' spatial
visualization scores increased over the semester by an average of 9.4%; however, students with
low spatial visualization ability underperform compared to their peers.

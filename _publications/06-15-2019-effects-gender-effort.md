Abstract: The objective of this study is to understand the interaction between gender, spatial visualization
ability, effort, and course outcomes in an engineering graphics course. Within engineering,
spatial visualization ability is essential to many applications, beginning with engineering
graphics. Engineering graphics courses are commonly introductory-level classes in engineering
programs, creating challenges for women, who on average score lower on tests of spatial
visualization ability. Improved understanding of gender differences in engineering graphics
classes could therefore help identify pedagogical areas to support women and increase their
retention in engineering programs. Although a gender gap exists in spatial ability and
performance in engineering graphics classes, female students still achieve positive course
outcomes. We hypothesize that: 1) female students put more effort into engineering graphics
courses; and 2) that this greater effort (measured as time spent on homework, homework scores,
quiz scores and attendance) by female students reduces the gender gap in course and exam
grades. By analyzing scores on homework, quizzes, exams, and attendance in addition to total
course score, we can better assess differences between students and quantify the relative
importance of different factors like effort and ability on student performance. We present data
from three semesters of a freshman-level engineering graphics course at a large research
university and analyze differences in spatial visualization ability and course outcomes of male
students (n=232) and female students (n=76). Female students scored lower on spatial
visualization tests and course exams but had higher performance in less time-restricted, effortrelated
outcomes, such as attendance and homework scores, compared to male students.
However, on average, female students had lower overall course grades. After accounting for the
spatial ability gender gap by comparing students in groups of similar visualization ability, we
found that female students with high spatial visualization abilities tended to have better
performance on less time-restricted, effort-related outcomes and took more time on homework,
but still had lower exam and course scores than their male counterparts. It appears that the
gender gap in performance may not be explained fully by spatial visualization, but could be
related to gender differences in testing. Better understanding of the differences between male and
female students of similar visualization ability could help educators identify opportunities to
leverage these differences in developing pedagogical strategies to support women in introductory
engineering graphics courses and further engineering pursuits.

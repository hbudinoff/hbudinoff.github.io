Here's a .csl file I modified to match the Interntional Journal of Engineering Education citation style, [available here](https://csl.mendeley.com/styles/496225251/IJEE-2). This style is based off their most recent "Guide for Authors", which is [available here](https://www.ijee.ie/2019_Guide_for_Authors.pdf). I did this to make citing easier for myself in Word. The .csl file worked well for me, but there may be bugs. Feel free to contact me if you found a bug I should address.

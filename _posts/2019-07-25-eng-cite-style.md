International Journal of Engineering Education citation style
====
Here's a .csl file I modified to match the Interntional Journal of Engineering Education citation style, [available here](https://csl.mendeley.com/styles/496225251/IJEE-2). You should be able to right click the link and choose "Save link as" or just use the address to upload it to whatever citation management system you use (I used it with Mendeley). This style is based off their most recent "Guide for Authors", which is [available here](https://www.ijee.ie/2019_Guide_for_Authors.pdf). I did this to make citing easier for myself in Word. The .csl file worked well for me, but there may be bugs. Feel free to contact me if you found a bug I should address. Hopefully when I'm bored I'll look at sharing this on the [CSL repository](https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles/wiki).

American Society of Mechanical Engineers 
=====
I found a useful, recently implemented version of the ASME citation style that works with Latex. I don't think any of the ASME conference or journal pages currently link to this, so I thought I'd repost. I've found a bug or two but it seems to work well. Thank you to the developer, John H. Lienhard.

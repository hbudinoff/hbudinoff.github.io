I am currently a PhD student studying mechanical engineering at the University of California, Berkeley. I work in the Computer Aided Design and Manufacturing Lab under [Professor Sara McMains](http://www.me.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/sara-mcmains). Generally, our lab focuses on computational and geometric problems related to manufacturing.

I completed my undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering at the University of Arizona, in Tucson, with minors in mathematics and French. Before I started graduate school, I worked as a design engineer at Honeywell Aerospace in Phoenix, AZ, where I worked in rotordynamics and structural groups. I also had the opportunity to work as a lecturer at Northern Arizona University for a year (2016-2017 school year), teaching undergraduate classes related to design. 

Outside of work, I enjoy running, biking, traveling, and eating.

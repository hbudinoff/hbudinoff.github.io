Hi! I am a researcher interested in manufacturability analysis, design science, and design for additive manufacturing. I started as an assistant professor in the Department of Systems and Industrial Engineering at the University of Arizona in Fall 2020. I recently recieved my PhD in mechanical engineering at the University of California, Berkeley. I worked in the Computer Aided Design and Manufacturing Lab under [Professor Sara McMains](http://www.me.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/sara-mcmains). Generally, the CADML lab focuses on computational and geometric problems related to manufacturing.

I completed my undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering at the University of Arizona, in Tucson, with minors in mathematics and French. Before I started graduate school, I worked as a design engineer at Honeywell Aerospace in Phoenix, AZ, where I worked on projects relating to rotordynamics and structural analysis in the Mechanical Systems, Structures and Dynamics group. I also had the opportunity to work as a lecturer at Northern Arizona University for a year (2016-2017 school year), teaching undergraduate mechanical engineering classes related to design.

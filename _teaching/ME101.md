I served as a graduate student instructor for Intro to Lean Manufacturing Systems in the spring semesters of 2015 and 2016. I prepared and delivered one 50-minute review class each week, in addition to grading and other administrative duties.

Course Catalog Description & Objectives
======
Description: Fundamentals of lean manufacturing systems including manufacturing fundamentals, unit operations and manufacturing line considerations for work in process (WIP), manufacturing lead time (MLT), economics, quality monitoring; high mix/low volume (HMLV) systems fundamentals including just in time (JIT), kanban, buffers and line balancing; class project/case studies for design and analysis of competitive manufacturing systems. Objectives: This course will enable students to analyze manufacturing lines in order to understand the production process and improve production efficiency. The course provides practical knowledge and skills that can be applied in industry, covering the complete manufacturing system from production planning to quality control. Students are given a chance to practice and implement what they learn during lectures by conducting projects with local or global manufacturing companies. (Source: classes.berkeley.edu).

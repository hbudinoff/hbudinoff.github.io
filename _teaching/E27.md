I was responsible for grading homework assignments for approximately 60 students enrolled in class that served as an introduction to manufacturing processes and geometric dimensioning and tolerancing.

Course Catalog Description & Objectives
======
Description: Geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T), tolerance analysis for fabrication, fundamentals of manufacturing processes (metal cutting, welding, joining, casting, molding, and layered manufacturing). Objectives: Enable a student to create and understand tolerances in engineering drawings; enhance critical thinking and design skills; emphasize communication skills, both written and oral; offer hands-on experience in manufacturing; develop abilities in identifying, formulating, and solving engineering problems; introduce students to the context of engineering practice.
